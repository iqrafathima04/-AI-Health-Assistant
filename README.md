## üí° Project: Agentic AI Health Symptom Checker 

### Problem Statement
An Agentic AI Health Symptom Checker helps users understand their health conditions by analyzing symptoms and providing probable causes, preventive advice, and care recommendations. It retrieves verified medical data, symptom databases, and guidelines from trusted sources like WHO, government health portals, and medical journals.

### Solution Overview
The Agentic AI Health Symptom Checker is a smart tool designed to:
- Analyze symptoms described in everyday language
- Provide trustworthy guidance from verified sources
- Suggest possible conditions with probability ratings
- Assign urgency levels (low/medium/high)
- Offer home care tips or doctor consultation advice
- Support multiple languages for wider accessibility

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technology Stack
- **Cloud Platform:** IBM Cloud
- **AI/ML Service:** IBM watsonx.ai
- **Model:** Llama-3-70b-instruct
- **Additional Tools:** Search engines (Google, Wikipedia, DuckDuckGo)

### üöÄ Project Workflow
1. **Configuration:** AI agent configured on IBM Cloud for health advice
2. **Tool Integration:** Added search engines for real-time data verification
3. **Multilingual Support:** Implemented support for English, Hindi, Kannada
4. **Deployment:** 
   - Saved as deployable asset in IBM Watsonx.ai
   - Deployed as Online Web Service with REST API endpoint
5. **Testing:** 
   - Validated with real symptom inputs (e.g., "fever and sore throat")
   - Verified accuracy of condition identification
   - Confirmed appropriate urgency level assignment
   - Ensured safe, actionable advice generation

### üìä Results
The deployed AI Health Symptom Checker demonstrated:
- High accuracy in symptom analysis
- Reliable health recommendations across multiple languages
- Effective integration with trusted medical sources
- Successful deployment on IBM Cloud infrastructure
