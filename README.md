Institute: SJC INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY
Duration: 4 Weeks (15th July 2025 to 7th August 2025)
📖 About the Internship
This 4-week program focused on providing practical skills in AI and Cloud Computing. The internship was structured with weekly virtual sessions, mentor guidance, and hands-on labs. The curriculum included:

Week 1: Internship Orientation, IBM Cloud Registration, Artificial Intelligence.
Week 2: Data Analytics concepts, Hands-On Labs, and Cloud EDA.
Week 3 & 4: Building a Chat Bot, AI/ML experiments on the cloud, Agentic AI experiments and a deep dive into AutoAI experiments on IBM Cloud.
Successful completion required active participation, completion of at least two courses on IBM SkillsBuild, and the submission of a final project presentation. This internship was offered with no stipend.

💡 Project: Agentic AI Health Symptom Checker 
Problem Statement
An Agentic AI Health Symptom Checker helps users understand their health conditions by analyzing symptoms and providing probable causes, preventive advice, and care recommendations. It retrieves verified medical data, symptom databases, and guidelines from trusted sources like WHO, government health portals, and medical journals.

Solution Overview
The Agentic AI Health Symptom Checker is a smart tool designed to help people understand their health symptoms accurately and safely. Many people search online for health advice but end up finding unreliable information, which can lead to confusion or delayed treatment. This AI-powered system solves this problem by analyzing symptoms described in everyday language (like "I have a headache and fever") and providing trustworthy guidance. It checks verified medical databases from sources like the WHO and CDC to suggest possible conditions, rate how urgent the symptoms are (low, medium, or high), and offer home care tips or advice to see a doctor if needed.

⚙️ Technology Stack
Cloud Platform: IBM Cloud
AI/ML Service: IBM watsonx.ai
Model:Llama-3-3-70b-instruct
 
🚀 Project Workflow
Instruction: I have configured the AI agent on IBM Cloud to provide health advice based on user-reported symptoms.
Tools Added: Included search engines like Google, Wikipedia, and DuckDuckGo.
The AI health symptom checker model supports multiple languages.
Deployment: The AI health symptom checker model was saved as a deployable asset and deployed as an Online Web Service within a Deployment Space on IBM Watsonx.ai. This provides a REST API endpoint for real-time symptom analysis and health recommendations.
Testing: The deployed API was tested with real-world symptom inputs (e.g., "fever and sore throat") to validate its accuracy in identifying probable conditions, assigning urgency levels (low/medium/high), and providing safe, actionable advice.
📊 Results
The deployed AI Health Symptom Checker demonstrated high accuracy in analyzing symptoms and providing reliable health recommendations across multiple languages, including English, Hindi, and Kannada. The project met all evaluation criteria, proving the effectiveness of IBM Watsonx.ai for accessible, AI-driven healthcare guidance.
